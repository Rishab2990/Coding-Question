# Coding-Question

Welcome to the **Coding_Question** repository! This repository is dedicated to my Java coding practice, where I solve and upload various coding questions. The focus of this repository will be on improving problem-solving skills, with an emphasis on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts.

## 📝 Repository Overview

In this repository, I will be posting:

1. **Java Coding Questions**: A collection of solved problems ranging from basic to advanced levels.
2. **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**: Solutions and implementations of DSA concepts.
3. **Future Projects**: As I progress, I will also be adding Java projects related to coding challenges and DSA.

## 🚀 What's Inside?

This repository will consist of:

### 1. Practice Problems
- Various coding problems solved using Java.
- Categories include arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, and more.
- Solutions will include detailed comments explaining the logic behind each approach.

### 2. Data Structures & Algorithms
- Explanation of core DSA concepts.
- Implementations of data structures like arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs.
- Algorithms like searching, sorting, recursion, and dynamic programming.

### 3. Future Plans
- I will be creating Java projects that involve DSA-based problem-solving.
- More coding challenges from various platforms (LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, etc.).
